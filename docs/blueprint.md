# **App Name**: AOS New Year Laughs

## Core Features:

- Landing Screen Animation: Animated landing screen with department selection and name input.
- Joke Delivery: Delivers a random joke based on selected department using a modal that does not repeat jokes until all are shown.
- Humorous Roast: Displays a witty, department-based roast message upon entering the main dashboard, reacting to user's choice of department
- Confetti Screenshot: Activates a confetti fountain effect and temporarily hides UI elements for clean screenshots, proving productivity, using canvas-confetti via CDN.
- Dynamic UI Transition: The Landing Screen dramatically splits or slides away to reveal the Party Zone.
- Gift Box Interactions: Gift boxes bob gently when idle, shake aggressively on hover, and launch the lid on click, revealing a joke modal.
- Welcome Message: Header greets the user, incorporating their name via a typewriter effect.

## Style Guidelines:

- Animated gradient background using dark blues (#0f172a, #1e293b, #334155) with slow color shifts to evoke a New Year's Eve atmosphere, accented with gold hues for a touch of luxury.
- Neon Green (#39FF14) glowing box-shadow for GIS button hover to represent technical precision, and Golden Amber (#FFBF00) for PLRA, representing wealth and legacy, with subtle gold gradients.
- Glassmorphism effect (backdrop-filter: blur(10px)) on modals and input cards for a modern, frosted glass look, enhanced with a slight gold shimmer.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, with gold accents on headers for visual appeal.
- Entrance effects: Elements slide up, fade in, and scale up using cubic-bezier easing for a bouncy, high-end feel, incorporating subtle gold particle effects.
- Button hover effects: Scale up (1.05x) and text spacing expands slightly on hover for better interactivity, with a gentle gold glow.
- Department Cards have a tilting 3D transform based on mouse position (or a strong hover lift if mouse tracking is unavailable), with a reflective gold surface.
- Subtle parallax scrolling effects on the background elements to create depth as the user navigates the page.
- Use of WebGL shaders for a shimmering or rippling effect on gold elements, adding a touch of realism and luxury.
- Micro-interactions throughout the UI, such as subtle animations on text hover or button presses, to provide feedback and engagement.
